# Working with Simple Features (SF)
## Summary
This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in October 2024. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2024.

### Session contents
This session will introduce you to using Simple Features for Geospatial Data Analysis through the case study of mapping Christmas Markets in Berlin and how it can be applied in a public policy context. 

### Main learning objectives
The goals of this session are to (1) Understand what geospatial analysis is and what is it used for (2) Have a high-level overview of the simple features package (3) Be equipped with using the most important functions in sf to perform geospatial analysis in a public policy context. 

## Tutorial
The session is accompanied by a tutorial, which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24-workshop/07-geospatial-analysis-sf-daum-pollex-sung/blob/main/Workshop_material.html).
